# Subnational Electricity and Gas Consumption

## I have completed this project as part of Level 3 Boot skills camp from CAmbridge Spark.
My objective is to:
Find the total electricity consumption with standard meters and E7 meters region-wise.
Determine electrical consumption from 2011 to 2021.
Compare domestic and non-domestic electrical consumption.
Analyze domestic and non-domestic electrical and gas consumption.

To achieve this, I downloaded data from the open-source website https://data.gov.uk/ in .CSV format and conducted precise data cleaning using Power Query. I carried out detailed data analysis, calculating statistical measures such as the mean. I integrated datasets of electricity and gas, facilitating a sophisticated exploration of total consumption across regions and differentiation between domestic and non-domestic usage using pivot tables.

I implemented data visualization techniques to convey detailed insights derived from the analyzed data. My analysis reveals notable differences in electricity consumption patterns across regions, with factors such as meter types and lockdown measures playing significant roles. Understanding these regional variances is crucial for developing targeted strategies to manage and optimize electricity usage efficiently.
